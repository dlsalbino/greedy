# greedy
REST API application using Hexagonal Architecture concepts.

## ABOUT THE APPLICATION
 The idea of the Greedy App is a simple API where people an schools can register (presential or online) technologies courses, besides, students can create an account to know when and where interested courses will go happen. 
 Perhaps, in the future I'll develop a frontend to consumes this API.  

 My intent with this project is, apply some knowledgments about **Hexagonal Architecture** obtained through reading articles on web.
 The application is a CRUD REST API developed using Java language and the Spring Framework. Inside you'll found somethings like:

- [x] Hexagonal Architecture
- [x] S.O.L.I.D. Principles
- [x] REST API Good Practices
- [x] API Documentation with OpenAPI
- [] Unit Tests with JUnit 5
- [] Security with JWT
- [] Containerization with Docker
